Full suite of a few themed skins for Rainmeter
First actual project, very scuffed currently
Feel free to add suggestions for icons or features

To switch icons, just replace the name of the icon stated by "ImageName" in the launcher
When making your own icons, make sure they are 512x, completely white, and fill the most of 
the 512x space as possible

To find the path for a program, search it in Cortana, right click->open file location, right 
click->properties, and copy paste "Target". (Or find a better guide)
